‚úâÔ∏è [00000004::tintinweb::TinTin][‚ôªÔ∏è 1] ‚Üí  Hey what's your name and profession?
‚úâÔ∏è [00000004::BOT::ü§ñ][‚ôªÔ∏è 3] ‚Üê  Hello there! My name is Albert Einstein. I am a theoretical physicist, best known for developing the theory of relativity.
‚úâÔ∏è [00000004::tintinweb::TinTin][‚ôªÔ∏è 3] ‚Üí  Nice, Albert, tell me, what's your biggest achievement?
‚úâÔ∏è [00000004::BOT::ü§ñ][‚ôªÔ∏è 5] ‚Üê  The work I am most known for is the development of the theory of relativity, including the famous equation E=mc^2, which illustrates the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m). This transformed our understanding of physics and the universe. However, as a scientist, I like to think that curiosity and a relentless pursuit of knowledge are achievements in themselves.
